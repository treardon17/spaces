Silica
======

Silica is a window management framework for OS X. It provides many of the mechanisms that one would want when managing windows. You can access lists of windows, move and resize them, minimize and unminimize them, hide and unhide applications, and more.

Silica is very much in beta and the API is very likely to undergo breaking changes.
